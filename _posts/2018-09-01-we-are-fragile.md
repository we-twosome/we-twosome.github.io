Let's be honest, not every day is a good day. And especially on those moody, period stricken days. So, a few days ago, I had similar kinda "bad" day but I'm writing about it because my boyfriend turned that day beautifully and I don't want to forget about it for both of us.

I had already asked him to pick me a little early but he ended up late which burst my frustration. He handled all the situations carefully, listened to my outpour, understood me, apologized and took the blame. He then took me to the place I was craving for, bought me dark chocolates and took on a ride away from the city. It was a lovely day. After a while in a relationship, we easily forget about our partners and gestures of love and compassion. We get so comfortable in the relationship that though not intended, we start taking each other for granted. As we start to fight with each other, we often forget that we are here to fight for each other. After the fall and catch, the journey of a relation starts with a constant battle: fighting with the world as well as ourselves to choose the other person, our love, above everything else. I'm glad that day my boyfriend reminded me of this with his gestures. There were so many ways that could have made that day worse, put a bitter mark on our relationship by both of us, however, he chose it to make it better for me and I chose him. After all, when it comes to a relationship, two is always better than one. :)
