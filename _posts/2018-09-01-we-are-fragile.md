We are taught from our childhood to be strong, to not cry when we fall or get hurt. But I think it never worked on me. I'm the most sensitive person of all that I know. Anyway this is about few days ago, when my day started rough and how my boyfriend took control of it all. I'm not sure if it was due to so many things that happened that morning all at once or just my period hormones that took over me and on top of that my head was also hurting. I had asked my boyfriend to pick me up a little sooner but when I called him at the said time, he was just about to leave home.
